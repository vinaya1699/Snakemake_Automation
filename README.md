## 📌 Overview  

This repository provides an automated **Snakemake pipeline** for **transcriptomics analysis**.  
The workflow is fully reproducible and currently supports steps up to **read count generation**.  

It is designed to:  
✔️ Simplify transcriptomics workflows  
✔️ Ensure reproducibility  
✔️ Scale efficiently with available computing resources  

---

## ⚡ Installation   and Usage

Install **Snakemake** via Conda:  

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
conda activate snakemake


🚀 Usage
```
1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/vinaya1699/Snakemake_Automation.git
cd Snakemake_Automation

2️⃣ Perform a dry run (check jobs without execution)
snakemake -n

3️⃣ Run the pipeline
snakemake -j 2

1) -j → Number of parallel jobs (adjust to available CPU cores).

⚙️ Example Configuration File

Define your samples, organism, and resources in config.yaml:

samples:
  Zinc_Sample: Zinc_Sample
  Control_Sample: Control_Sample

organism:
  Mus_musculus: Mus_musculus

threads:
  threads: 10
